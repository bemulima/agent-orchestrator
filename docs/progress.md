# Implementation progress

Last updated: 2026-07-20

## Current status

Stage 1 is complete and verified. The clean Docker Compose stack is currently
running with PostgreSQL, Temporal, Temporal UI, the HTTP API, and the worker.
Stages 2–8 have not been implemented and are not represented by placeholders.

## Completed

- Read the complete product specification.
- Inspected the reference repository instructions, documentation, module
  dependencies, composition root, configuration, domain/repository contracts,
  use cases, HTTP router/handlers, pgx adapters, migrations, tests, Docker,
  Compose, Makefile, Taskfile, logging, and error handling.
- Recorded the eight implementation stages and cross-cutting safety
  invariants.
- Created the Go module with the reference-compatible `cmd`, `domain`,
  `usecase`, and `adapters` dependency direction and explicit DI.
- Added environment configuration with absolute repository paths, filesystem
  root rejection, execution limits, redacted diagnostics, integration secrets,
  and configurable `fast`, `standard`, `deep`, and `review` model profiles.
- Added the minimum requested domain entities and a reversible PostgreSQL
  migration with foreign keys, status/value checks, JSONB fields, indexes, and
  idempotency constraints.
- Added tracked, transactional `migrate`/`migrate-down` scripts.
- Added `GET /health`, `GET /ready`, a common JSON error envelope, request IDs,
  structured zap request logs, dependency checks, and graceful shutdown.
- Added a Temporal worker, deterministic system probe workflow, probe activity,
  retry policy, structured zap adapter, and CLI probe command.
- Added a non-root multi-stage Docker image and Compose services for PostgreSQL,
  Temporal Server, Temporal UI, API, and worker.
- Added Make targets for bootstrap, lifecycle, migrations, Temporal UI, local
  API/worker/probe, configuration validation, formatting, lint, unit tests,
  integration tests, and verification.
- Verified a clean first start after deleting only the disposable test volumes;
  Temporal auto-setup created its own databases successfully.

## Files changed

- Root: `.dockerignore`, `.env.dist`, `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`, `Makefile`,
  `README.md`, `docker-compose.yml`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`.
- Entrypoint: `cmd/course-dev-orchestrator/main.go`.
- Domain/config: `internal/config/*`, `internal/domain/*`.
- Application/transport: `internal/usecase/health/*`,
  `internal/adapters/http/*`.
- Infrastructure: `internal/adapters/postgres/*`,
  `internal/adapters/temporal/*`, `internal/activities/*`,
  `internal/workflow/*`.
- Database/runtime: `db/migrations/*`, `scripts/migrate*.sh`,
  `docker/Dockerfile`.
- Tests: package-local `*_test.go` files and
  `test/integration/postgres_schema_test.go`.
- Documentation: `docs/architecture-conventions.md`,
  `docs/implementation-plan.md`, `docs/progress.md`.

## Tests

- `make verify` — passed (`gofmt` check, `go vet`, unit/workflow/HTTP/config
  tests, `docker compose config`).
- `go test -race ./...` — passed.
- `make migrate` twice — passed; second run skipped the applied migration.
- `make migrate-down && make migrate` — passed.
- `make test-integration` — passed; core tables and project/command
  idempotency constraints verified against PostgreSQL 16.
- Clean `docker compose up -d --build` — passed; all long-running services are
  running and dependency health checks pass.
- `GET /health` and `GET /ready` — returned HTTP 200 with `status=ok`.
- `make workflow-probe` — passed through the real Temporal worker and returned
  structured `status=ok` output.

## Remaining work

- Stage 2: project persistence, idempotent local/Git connection, allowlisted
  path resolution, read-only discovery, evidence reports, fixtures, and tests.
- Stages 3–8 remain as specified in `docs/implementation-plan.md`; in
  particular `.ai` onboarding, topology, planning, Codex runner, GitLab, and
  Telegram are not yet implemented.

## Exact next task

Implement `ProjectRepository` with pgx and its repository tests, then implement
`ConnectProject` for canonical local paths with `REPOSITORY_ALLOWED_ROOTS`
enforcement and idempotency before adding Git clone support or discovery.
